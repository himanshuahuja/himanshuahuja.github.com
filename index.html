<p><br>Maybe you've known me for a while or maybe we've only recently got to know each other. Either way, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to visit my website. <br><br>With a population of over a billion people in India, its possible that maybe you were looking for a different Himanshu Ahuja. No worries, I'll tell you a bit about myself and you can figure out if I'm the right one :)</p>

<pre><code>• From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow">Lucknow</a>

<p>Hopefully by now you know whether or not I am the Himanshu Ahuja you intended to find.</p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A bit more about me</h3>

<p><br>I have always been a keen biker and currently I drive a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Thunderbird">Bullet Thunderbird 350</a>. <br><br>If you want to know what modifications I’ve made to my motorcycle, I’ll be happy to share photos with you.<br><br>
I’m a bit of crazy about road trips with my friends and much to my mother’s angst, here are some of my road trips - <br>
• Delhi to Lucknow and back three times, approx 520 km one way<br>
• Pune to Lucknow and back twice, approx 1380 km one way<br>
• Pune to Ahmedabad and back once, approx 700 km one way<br><br>
Now these trips were done in the car.
For 2014 I'm planning to take a couple of friends and my brother on a ultra road trip on a Bullet 500. Its going to be from Delhi to Ladakh and back! 
If all goes well, we’ll drive down from Delhi to Mumbai after a one week break. <br><br>
You're probably thinking its a lot of driving - Well, it is!<br><br> But remember this - <strong>"Four wheels move the body. Two wheels move the soul."</strong>
</p><br>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How about the professional bit?</h3>
<br>
<p>I studied marketing at university but quickly realised that studying marketing is actually just the beginning. Its the beginning of the understanding that goes behind selling something. <br><br>
In this superbly connected world that we live in today has a lot of innovation and lots of products but the one thread that ties them all together is that they all need customers. Without paying customers, a product is at best a great concept. <br><br> 
If you think I'm exaggerating, consider the following quote by Thomas J Watson - <strong>"Nothing happens until someone sells something".</strong><br><br>
This is where I come in. <u>I have worked with several companies and brought them several clients and several crores in business.</u> <br><br>
I am able to sell so well only due to one reason - I never aim to sell, I aim to solve a customer problem. If there is no problem, I never push to sell but the interesting thing is that I have yet to find a prospect who doesn't have a problem. There is always a problem if you look hard enough and I always look harder than anyone else.<br><br>
I hope this gives you a good idea about me and if you want to see further then please check out my CV page.
